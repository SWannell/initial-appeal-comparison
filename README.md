Tracking appeals against similar appeals from launch, for the first few weeks.

- Take appeals from the first day they hit 500 gifts/day, and track total platform daytime unpaid income from there. ([GA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y39zG09udanEAxchr7_w0XhXAh-X3OmEosruTUKY3Uo/edit#gid=1155027884)).
